Fixtures
===========

Fixtures are static data that we can use for fake api responses and other pieces of data.

#### MangaEden
These are responses we'd expect from the mangaEden api endpoints.

#### Public
These are responses we'd expect for image requests

#### Types
This represents the kind of data we see if we look at our internally-formatted library.
