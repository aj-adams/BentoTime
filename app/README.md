App
=========

App is the root of our application!


#### How to use:

Once compiled, App.js will append our entire application to the DOM node with the id `mountPoint`.  So the only thing we need to do is include the compiled Javascript script (using app.jsx as an entry point), and add the `mountPoint` node to our application.  That ends up looking something like this:

```html
<body>
  <div>
    <div id="mountPoint" />
  </div>
  <script async src="build/main.js"></script>
</body>
```

The entire html of our application is found in [index.html](../public/index.html).


#### Further Detail

Because it's the entry-point of our application, a lot of the technologies we use are introduced in its use. Not much is actually happening, but there is some syntax that might be unfamiliar to the uninitiated.

Our custom [Store](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/Store.html) is created in `store.js`, and is used to handle our data.  Read: all of our Manga and User data is stored here.

Our [Provider](http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html) is provided (heh) to us by React-Redux, and simply makes the store available to all components in the application without passing it explicitly. We pass it our store, and React-Redux takes care of the rest (pretty much)!

Our [Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) is initiated here as well, since our entire page is being affected pretty much right at the top.  We do have a wrapper for all of our routes [(Layout.js)](./containers/Layout), but we keep it nested within our `<Router />`, since it makes it easier to use all the information about our Route.
