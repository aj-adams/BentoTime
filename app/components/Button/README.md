Button
=========

Currently a Button component is just a button element and lets us apply styles in this directory.  However, this gives us the option of further extending Buttons in the future without changing our pre-existing code.

#### How to use:

```js
import Button from 'app/components/Button';

<Button />
```

#### Props

* All props are passed through to the resulting Button
