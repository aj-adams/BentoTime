BookListItem
=========

BookListItem takes in a book, and displays data meant to be consumed in the form of a list.  It is used in the [BookList](../BookList) component.  It serves as a way to link to our BookView.

#### How to use:

```js
import BookListItem from 'app/components/BookListItem';

<BookListItem key={key} book={book} />
```

#### Props

* `book`: An single [Book](../../data/models/Book)
* `key`: Helps us keep track of a list of BookListItems
