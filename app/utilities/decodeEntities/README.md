decodeEntities
=========

 Decodes html entities in strings. Uses the browser to decode rather than using
 a entity database like [he.js](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he).
 
 decodeEntities is a function that has a closure over a new html page so a
 new one isn't created on each function call.


#### How to use:

```js
import decodeEntities from 'app/utilities/decodeEntities';

var htmlEntities = '&ldquo;Hello&rdquo;'
var decoded = decodeEntities(htmlEntities);
```
